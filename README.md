## General Info
This is an automatic dog feeder that will feed a selected portion of food twice a day at the times set. It uses a cereal dispenser, a small geared motor, a real-time clock, and an Atmega 328p to automatically feed your dog.

There is also a button to manually feed the dog and a toggle switch to disable automatic feeding (for when the dog is not around or special dietary needs are temporarily needed.)
